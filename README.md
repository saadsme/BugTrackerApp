# BugTrackerApp
The Bug Tracker app is a mobile application for Android devices that allows users to report and track bugs and issues in software or other systems.
The app was developed using Java and the Firebase platform, which provides a cloud-based database and authentication services.
Users can create an account and log in to the app to submit new bug reports, which are stored in the Firebase database and can be accessed and modified by authorized users.
The app also includes features such as a dashboard to view and filter existing bug reports, and a notification system to alert users of updates or changes to their reports.
